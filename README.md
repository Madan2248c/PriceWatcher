# Amazon Price Watcher Bot

---

This is a Telegram bot built with Node.js that helps you monitor the prices of Amazon products and notifies you when the price drops below a target value you specify. The bot provides an easy way to track product prices directly through your Telegram account, sending real-time notifications.

## Features

- **Monitor any Amazon product**: Track the price of any Amazon product by providing its URL.
- **Real-time notifications**: Receive alerts when the product price drops below your target price.
- **Simple commands**: Use easy-to-remember commands to set up your price tracking.
- **Fully automated**: No manual checks requiredâ€”the bot will handle everything for you.
- **Telegram integration**: Accessible on any platform that supports Telegram (mobile, desktop, and web).

## How It Works

1. **Start the Bot**:

   - Start a chat with the bot on Telegram: [@mprice_watcher_bot](https://t.me/mprice_watcher_bot).
2. **Track a Product**:

   - Use the following command to track a product:
     ```bash
     /watchprice <URL> <Target_Price>
     ```

     Where:- `<URL>` is the Amazon product URL you want to monitor.
     - `<Target_Price>` is the price threshold below which you want to receive a notification.
3. **Receive Notifications**:

   - Once the product's price drops below your set target price, the bot will send you an alert.

### Example Command

```bash
/watchprice https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KH53NKR 299
```

This command will monitor the product at the specified URL and notify you when the price falls below $299.
